# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Using-Excel
In this project, I analyzed an HR dataset to uncover insights about employee attrition. Built entirely with Microsoft Excel, the dashboard includes pivot tables, charts, and slicers to visualize trends across several employee attributes. The goal is to help HR teams understand key factors driving attrition and inform data-driven decision-making.
