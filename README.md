  ### Methodology
  This project analyzes employee attrition trends using Microsoft Excel, focusing on data transformation, analysis, and visualization:

 - **Data Import & Transformation**  
   The IBM HR dataset was imported into Excel. Data Cleaning was done by removing Unnecessary columns, excess spaces,duplicates etc. Relevant data types were verified, and new calculated fields like attrition rate and average income were created using formulas.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Pivot Tables were used to analyze the data from different anglesâ€”by department, job role, gender, education, and more. This helped in identifying key trends, such as high attrition areas or departments with low satisfaction scores.

- **Data Visualisation**  
   An interactive dashboard was built using Pivot Charts and Slicers. Charts like bar graphs, line charts, and doughnut visuals were employed to make the insights intuitive and visually appealing.These dashboards made it more easier to communicate our findings and results and also to highlight the key factors contributing to employee attrition in the organization. Slicers made the dashboard dynamic, allowing users to filter and explore data in real time.

- **Insight Extraction**  
   The final dashboard provided actionable insights around attrition, employee income, job satisfaction, and promotion delays. These insights can help HR departments make more informed decisions around employee engagement and retention strategies.
